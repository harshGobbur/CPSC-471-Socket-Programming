## Introduction
This report outlines the initial planning phase of our programming assignment for CPSC-471. The assignment involves developing a simplified FTP server and client application. The primary goals of this project are to understand the intricacies of protocol design, challenges in developing complex network applications, and practical applications of socket programming APIs.

## Goals Identified
- **Understanding Protocol Design:** Grasping the complexities involved in designing efficient and reliable communication protocols.
- **Real-world Application Development:** Tackling the challenges associated with developing applications that mimic real-world scenarios.
- **Socket Programming Mastery:** Gaining hands-on experience with socket programming APIs.

### Tools and Technologies Selected
- **Programming Language:** Python, for its simplicity and native server-hosting capabilities

### Challenges Anticipated
1. Ensuring seamless and efficient file transfer operations, especially handling large files.
2. Designing a robust protocol that effectively manages control and data connections.
3. Synchronizing work among team members to meet project milestones.

## Next Steps

### Research: 
Each member will gather additional resources and tutorials on their respective areas of responsibility.

### Initial Setup: 
Setting up the development environment, including version control repositories and basic project structure.

### Weekly Check-ins: 
Starting next week, we will hold weekly meetings to track progress, address challenges, and adjust roles as needed.
